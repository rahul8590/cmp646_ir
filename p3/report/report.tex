\section{Introduction}

In Distributed Information Reterival systems, information is held in separate collections, which might be in different physical locations or on separate servers. The query is first passed to a central
broker. The broker then sends this query to all or some of the servers. The cost of networking during query execution seems an overhead, escepially if the query is sent to servers which dont have similar collections.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig:1}DIR System.}
\end{figure}


Thus, DIR has 2 major issues to be resolved. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Selection of a particular collection
\item Merging of Results.
\end{enumerate}
In this report, we are mainly focusing on selection of collections. We are focusing on how to characterize a 
particular collection such that, the broker can decide on which servers to send the queries to further probe for 
results. We further explore 2 main sampling techniques which are used to represent collection of sets.

\section{Query Probing}
In non-cooperative environments like distributed systems. We dont get index information from each of the collections that are being fetched. Instead, its the brokers that constantly probe into the collection by sending artificial queries in random order and evaluate returned answers. The answers are called \texttt{probes} 
and the process is called \texttt{query probing}. For example, if we send a series of single probe queries such as "books", "football", "ibm" and the following number of answers are returned: 1000, 200, 450 . From the results we can guess that, the documents are more likely to talk about Books and IBM rather than football. 


The following is the algorithm initially proposed by Callan et al [1], which iteratively discovers the 
language model of the collections in non-cooperative environments.The language model is updated 
according to the new terms found in the retrieved documents. The next probe queries are selected from the obtained language model. Probing continues until a stopping criterion is met.




\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Query Sampling}\label{Query Sampling}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{QS}{}
\State Select an Initial Query Term
\State Run Query on the IR System
\State Reterive Top N Documents as Result.
\State Update the Resource Description based on characterstics of retreived documents. 
\BState \emph{loop}:
\State for words,freq in Documents
\State Update Learned Resource Descriptions.

\If {$\textit{StopCriteria()} = \textit{Yes}$}
\State break;
\Else 
\State Goto 3
\EndIf
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}



The algorithm has many open ended choices which needs to be tuned. For example, how to select query terms 
and how to select documents to examin per query and most importantly \textit{when to stop sampling}.
Callan et al suggested that assigning $N = 4$  and  $StopCriteria = 75$ Docs i.e examining a total of 300 documents will be a good representation of the collection.


\section{Sampling Techniques}
\label{sec:examples}


\subsection{Static Sampling using Ctf}

Use \texttt{section}s and \texttt{subsection}s to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use \texttt{ref} and \texttt{label} for cross-references --- this is Section~\ref{sec:examples}, for example.



\subsection{Adaptive Query Probing}

Use \texttt{tabular} for basic tables. You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the files menu. To include it in your document, use the \texttt{includegraphics} command (see the comment below in the source code).

% Commands to include a figure:
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{your-figure's-file-name}
%\caption{\label{fig:your-figure}Caption goes here.}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\section{Measure of Effectiveness}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\subsection{Significant terms}

\subsection{Result Evaluation}
